Holiday Ornament or Trinket

What holiday is complete without a theme shaped pcb with flahing lights and a piezo soundtrack?

Use the microcontroller to flash as many led's as posible on a 9v battery in several pleasing 
themes and play lovely piezo electric music to match.
Add a safety pin and it is a perfect complement to the madatory sweater!

This is the perfect cliche holiday project.
