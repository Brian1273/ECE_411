minimum quantities are probably more than 4 to ensure replacement parts (spares) are available.
This is just the absolute minimum to build 4 units.

From http://www.digikey.com:


LM78L05 (price: $0.63 each, qty 4 required)
--> LM78L05ACMX/NOPBTR-ND

LM386  (price: $0.88 each, qty: 4 required)
--> LM386MX-1/NOPBCT-ND

PIC16F648A (price: $ 1.97 each, qty: 4 required)
--> PIC16F648A-I/P-ND
