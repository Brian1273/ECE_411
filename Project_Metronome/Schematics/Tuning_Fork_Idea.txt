Electronic Tuning Fork

Use a microcontroller to output to a speaker or piezo buzzer a single tone in half steps through four octaves
This seems tricky to me because the software and hardware will have to be tuned precisly,
probably via some external potentiometers on analog inputs.
Use a button or rotary switch to select the tone and display on a 3 digit display
