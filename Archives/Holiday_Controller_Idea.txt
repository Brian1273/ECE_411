Holiday Light Controller

Use a microcontroller to control a relay that controls power to a holiday string lighting.
Use a conventional plug strip and some metal seperation inside for the low voltage.
Input a signal to the microcontroller via a debounced dc switch to select the theme.
Output the signals to several transistors controlling several 5vdc 120vac 2amp relays (optocoupler?)
The controller will then turn the relays on and off in several pleasing themes.
Allow for manual shut down with the power off switch on the plug strip
Provide power to the contoller and support hardware from 120vac

I don't have a good small circuit worked out that has been tested to provide usable power from 120vac
May need to use a pre-packaged power supply.

This would be a nice practical holiday project.
